## Devices

Introducing cosmos hardware. The bulk of the work initially on cosmos will be focused on the software. But, there will be open source cosmos hardware developed to ensure that access to the software is not limited to the people that can afford the hardware to run it. This means that not only will there be plans and tutorials to create cosmos devices, but there will also be funds set up that allow for people to access hardware and data connections for free.
