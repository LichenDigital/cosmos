## What is cosmos

cosmos is an open source event driven, asyncronous, modular, distributed, cross platform application framework and eventual operating system. It is also a software and hardware platform built with and to support the framework. It's primary focus is enhancing access and connectivity of systems through simplification, abstraction, and standardization. The cosmos community is open, diverse, and inclusive. As is the source code, protocol, and hardware, which is available in a variety of languages and supports people of all ability.

## Modules:

### Core
**[auth](./modules/auth.md)**
Handles user and user group management, authentication, and authorization. The built in permission system is built on top of the cosmos [event](./modules/event.md) system.

**[config](./modules/config.md)**
Manages configuration settings in a centralized manner, allowing different parts of cosmos to access these settings.

**[error](./modules/error.md)**
Handles error reporting and exception handling in a standardized way.

**[event](./modules/event.md)**
An event system designed to handle building complex reactive systems. Integrated systems for monitoring the event system are included in the admin interface for cosmos.

**[math](./modules/math.md)**
Provides standardized tools to handle math operations.

**[performance](./modules/performance.md)**
Provides caching mechanisms and other tools and techniques specifically aimed at analyzing and optimizing application performance.

**[protocol](./modules/protocol.md)**
Handles the protocol interpretation and compatability for all cosmos modules.

**[security](./modules/security.md)**
Security supports encryption on streams and static sources of data and provides vulnerability scanning, secure coding practices, and security audits. This module provides tools and guidelines to ensure applications built with cosmos are secure by design.

**[test](./modules/test.md)**
Includes utilities for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing


### Data
**[data](./modules/data.md)**
Operations on data like hashing, chunking, diffing, and validating. Manages stores of data in a variety of file systems, databases, and memory, accross devices. Generates ids and fingerprints of various types (alpha numeric, UUIDs).

**[history](./modules/history.md)**
Handles the history and versioning of every resource that cosmos interacts with. It is conditionally optional, but very powerful if enabled.

**[insight](./modules/insight.md)**
Covers pattern recognition, user interaction tracking, system performance metrics, AI models, and training capabilities, offering a comprehensive toolkit for data-driven decision-making.


### User Interface
**[graphics](./modules/graphics.md)**
Draws and renders 2D and 3D elements. Used for graphic design, 2D and 3D CAD and VFX.

**[ux](./modules/ux.md)**
Used for building beautiful, accessible, cross platform, reactive and connected multi-language user interfaces, as well as simple static media. UI has modules that handle displaying components on everything from high DPI screens to 8-bit lcd displays. 


### Communication
**[media](./modules/media.md)**
Supports management of `audio`, `images`, and `video` resources including converting, transpiling, and editing.

**[communication](./modules/communication.md)**
Two major features, setting up lower level networking transports, and higher level messaging protocols. Transports data between cosmos nodes and other end points, over a variety of software protocols and hardware protocols. Message supports sending data (be it text or other forms of data) through different forms of messaging methods. It supports SMS, email, and other message protocols. We'll have to figure out a module for voice communication, and how to do things like text over voice, and voice over text etc.

**[translate](./modules/translate.md)**
Translate text, audio, and imagery from one form to another. This covers both spoken and programming / scripting languages.


### Infrastructure
**[iot](./modules/iot.md)**
Facilitates the development of applications that interact with IoT devices, sensors, and controls. This could include device management, data collection, and real-time monitoring

**[microservices](./modules/microservices.md)**
Provides patterns, best practices, and tools for building applications as a collection of loosely coupled services. This architectural style is beneficial for complex applications that require high scalability and flexibility.

**[system](./modules/system.md)**
Manage the system that cosmos is running on. This includes both the software (like processes running, memory usage), and hardware (storage, monitor temperatures etc.).


### Transactions

**[finance](./modules/finance.md)** Handle conversion, sending, recieving, processing, and storing money.

**[blockchain](./modules/blockchain.md)**
Tools for creating decentralized applications, smart contracts, and managing digital transactions securely.



## Software Development Methodology
The development of cosmos will take a lot of effort, thought, and careful planning. In order to guide this endeavor we've got a [document](design-development.md) that outlines our design and development philosophy, ideas, and questions.
