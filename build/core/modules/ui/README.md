# cosmos ui

The cosmos web UI is a toolset for building responsive, modern, and beautiful web user interfaces. It utilizes SASS (compiled to CSS), javascript, and SVGs to provide elegant components for building web applications. Eventually it will be integrated into cosmos's backend and universal UI protocol.

```
|create id [ button ]

|create id [ input { size.width=.25in }, button ]

|create group [ video, button ]
```

cosmos is:
* modular
* responsive
* beautiful

* mobile first
* lightweight
* fast
* scalable
* customizable
* modern

* visual styles

* box-model
* flex-box


## cosmos ui protocol
```
composition {
  component-name,
  id,
  group,
  uid READ-ONLY,
  fingerprint READ-ONLY
}
```

### composition

- **id** - this is an Identifier that the user can create etc.
- **group** - this is a Group that the user can create etc.
- **uid** - this is a READ-ONLY Unique Identifier that is autogenerated and is read only.
- **fingerprint** - this is READ-ONLY and is a Fingerprint that belongs to that composition of component. It's calculated using - **hashing**, and differs from uid, in that you can have two components with the same fingerprint, if they have the same makeup. - **Fingerprints are by default identified and instanced to save on performance.
