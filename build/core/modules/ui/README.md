# cosmos ui

The cosmos web UI is a toolset for building responsive, modern, and beautiful web user interfaces. It utilizes SASS (compiled to CSS), javascript, and SVGs to provide elegant components for building web applications. Eventually it will be integrated into cosmos's backend and universal UI protocol.
