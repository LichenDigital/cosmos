||||| COSMOS INPUTS |||||

SHAPES:
    rectangle
    square
    circle (experimental)

VARIENTS:
    bordered (default)
    solid
    outlined
    underlined

MODIFIERS:
    rounded-corners
    rounded-ends

STATES:
    hover
    active
    focus

DELOPMENT NOTES:
    Much like buttons, input fields can contain icons and labels, and be used in controls. They can have outer labels in feilds and have inner placeholders (or have inner labels that move when focused or filled.)

    I need to make a decision on default input styling.
