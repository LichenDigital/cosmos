||||| COSMOS LABELS |||||

Labels in cosmos have more uses than the traditional HTML element.

They behave differently based on whether they are contained in a control, or if they are placed within other control elements like buttons, inputs, textareas, containers etc. (if contained in a control, they default to the same sizing of the other control elements (driven by the control itself). If it appears within a feildset, it will default to its text label format.

These visual behaviors are to be designed as having certain location and context dependant visual appearances, while being abel to be overriden by classes or SASS variables.

Or... Shall I develop a different term to only explicitly use label as it should be used... And use a different term like badge, tag, or detail...

// Inner labels are not very usable, as actual labels of inputs go. For two reasons
// 1. They can be confused for filled out form
// 2. They can be overlooked

// Not going to be used for now...

//     transform: translateY(-50%);
