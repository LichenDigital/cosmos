# cosmos is a distributed open source framework
---
cosmos is a distributed, open source, cross platform application framework and eventual operating system. It is also a lightning fast software and hardware platform built with and to support the framework. It's primary focus is enhancing access and connectivity of systems through simplification, abstraction, and standardization, while striving to be event driven, asynchronous, modularm, and beautiful. The cosmos community is open, diverse, and inclusive. As is the source code, protocol, and hardware, which is available in a variety of languages and supports people of all ability.

cosmos = âˆž

## Software Documentation
Take a deep dive into the [documentation](documentation/documentation.md). It's a work in progress and will be largely built out before cosmos is. It's documentation first nature, allows for the guidance in the development of cosmos.

## Hardware
cosmos is not just a software platform. It is also an ecosystem of [open source hardware](documentation/hardware-development.md) that follows a wholistic philosophy: develop usabile, repairable, feature rich, accessible, extensible, and beautiful hardware that is environmentally friendly. We're working to have our cake and eat it too.
