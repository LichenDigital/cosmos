# cosmos - a distributed open source application framework
---
cosmos is an open source, distributed, cross platform application framework and eventual operating system. It is also a lightning fast software and hardware platform built with and to support the framework. It's primary focus is enhancing access and connectivity of systems through simplification, abstraction, and standardization, while striving to be event driven, asynchronous, modular. The cosmos community is open, diverse, and inclusive. As is the source code, protocol, and hardware, which is available in a variety of languages and supports people of all ability.
